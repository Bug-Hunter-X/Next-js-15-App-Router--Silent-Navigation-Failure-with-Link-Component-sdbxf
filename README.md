# Next.js 15 App Router: Silent Navigation Failure

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when using the `Link` component for client-side navigation.  Under certain conditions, navigation fails silently without throwing any errors, making debugging difficult.

## Bug Description

The `Link` component, when used with specific routes or routing configurations, does not perform the expected client-side navigation. The UI doesn't reflect the intended page change, and no errors are logged in the browser's console.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate between the 'Home' and 'About' links.  Observe that while the links seem to work visually, no actual navigation occurs in some cases. (Specific conditions triggering this failure might depend on server-side configuration and routing setup.)

## Solution

A solution might involve carefully reviewing the application's routing configuration, ensuring proper middleware, and using `useSearchParams` to handle dynamic routes properly.  Sometimes, the issue stems from missing or incorrectly configured server components, especially those that should be handling data fetching or authorization for the involved routes.

## Potential Causes

* **Incorrectly configured routes:** Problems in the `app` directory's structure or route definitions.
* **Middleware interference:** Unexpected behavior from middleware functions that intercept navigation.
* **Client-side data fetching:** Asynchronous data fetching might not be properly handled, leading to inconsistent UI updates.
* **Missing or incorrect server components:** These are crucial for handling data fetching, authorization, and other server-side tasks.
